Program 'geodesic' is a user friendly command driven method to determine
various properties of geodesics or "Great Circle" paths.

---------------------------------------

REQUIREMENT: static or dynamic library "libproject.*" must be install on
host system a path recognizable to the loader---typically /usr/local/lib.
Similarly, file "project.h" must be similarly installed.

---------------------------------------

NOTICE:

Command line option processing is done with the assistance of
program 'gengetopt' (see

http://www.gnu.org/software/gengetopt/gengetopt.html#dir

).  Any changes to file src/geodesic.ggo will need to be processed
by:

gengetopt --input=geodesic.ggo --file-name=geodesic_cmd

before recompiling/linking the program.
